So in order to interact with the community you will have to got to https://lists.osgeo.org/mailman/listinfo/mapbender_users and create a subscription to the application. Then you would have to enter the admin address and password which I am clueless on. So I have posted a question on to there twitter page about my issue with the link to the twitter site here https://twitter.com/search?q=%40mapbender&src=typ. The screenshot!
